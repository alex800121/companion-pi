First of all, you're going to want a fast Micro SD card. One of the most popular ones currently on the market is the SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB card ([on Amazon, here (Amazon US)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XYHN68L)). This isn't always going to be _the best_ one to use, but it is a very good, adequately fast microSD card. Look for anything that is classified as UHS 1 or higher as these will have the read/write speeds you need for your Raspberry Pi to be useful instead of a slow pain in the neck.

Once you've got your fast microSD card in hand, you'll need a tool for flashing the image to the card. One of the most popular tools is Balena Etcher (Windows, Mac, and Linux). It's very easy to use. You can [download it here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

> On first boot, it'll take a few minutes for the Admin User Interface to be available. The OS has to resize itself to the capacity of your SD card and that takes an extra reboot.
