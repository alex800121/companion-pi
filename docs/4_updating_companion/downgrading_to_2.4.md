While it is no longer supported, you can downgrade your installation of v3 to v2.4.2.  
This process will take many minutes to run, as it has to compile Companion from the source.

* `sudo git clone https://github.com/bitfocus/companion.git -b stable-2.4 stable-2.4 /usr/local/src/companion`
* `sudo companion-update`
