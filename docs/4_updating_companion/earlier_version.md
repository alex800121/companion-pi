If your CompanionPi install was made with the install script, or using an image of 2.2.0 or later, you can use the updater to easily update to the latest version.

If you have a CompanionPi install that was made before the 2.2.0 CompanionPi image, it is recommended that you backup your config and reimport it into a fresh installation.

A lot has changed in the 2.2.0 builds, including an overhaul of the CompanionPi images. The major change is the ability for CompanionPi to manage various dependencies itself, allowing updates after that version to be done in a seamless manner.
